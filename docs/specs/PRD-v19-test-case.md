# PRD v19.0: Test Case for Improved Prompt System

## Executive Summary
Test case PRD to validate the improved prompt system that properly separates docs/specs (immutable) from docs/CURRENT (session-based)

## Background
- **Issue**: Current prompt doesn't automatically generate specs from PRD
- **Solution**: Modified prompt with mandatory specs decomposition

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Automatic specs extraction from PRD
- Clear separation of permanent vs temporary documents
- Session-based planning in CURRENT directory

### Non-Functional Requirements  
- 100% PRD decomposition rate
- Clear architectural documentation
- Maintainable document structure

## Technical Design

### Architecture Components
```python
class SpecsManager:
    def extract_requirements(self, prd_content):
        # Extract all requirements automatically
        return consolidated_requirements
    
    def extract_architecture(self, prd_content):
        # Extract system design automatically  
        return architectural_specs
```

### Data Structure
```json
{
  "specs": {
    "requirements": "docs/specs/requirements.md",
    "architecture": "docs/specs/architecture.md", 
    "project_rules": "docs/specs/project_rules.md"
  },
  "session": {
    "planning": "docs/CURRENT/session-planning.md",
    "todos": "docs/CURRENT/active-todos.md"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Plan
- Week 1: Prompt modification
- Week 2: Testing and validation
- Week 3: Documentation and rollout

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Automatic specs generation
- [ ] Clean docs separation  
- [ ] Validated with test cases
